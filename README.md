# Audio_Player
This is my Java project, where I have designed a mobile application capable of accessing internal storage to play audio files, functioning similarly to a traditional music player.


The proposed Android Audio Player will be a versatile application with the following features:
- **Audio Playback**: Support for multiple audio formats such as MP3, WAV, AAC.
- **Playback Controls**: Standard playback controls (play, pause, stop, next, previous).
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume levels within the app.
- **Track Information**: Display details such as title, artist, album, duration.
- **ID3 Tag Editor**: Edit metadata of audio files.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface with material design elements.
